    ANS : At the time of compilying Microservices gives the result for only one problem at a time.It fills a decent need for this type of detachment of concern and solidarity inside a specified Microservice . Oe layer of APIs are expanded by the another layer of sorted APIs for more informational index , which doesn't really manage the raw data, however manages bits of insights.
For uncovering larger amount administrations Microservices connected as a method for applying prescient strategies, into a designing platform.., for example, product to product recommendations,proposals, identifying anomalies,  etc
